This is just a project to play around with a combination of traditional AI and reinforcement learning in Starcraft 2.

I would like to credit Harrison at https://pythonprogramming.net/ for his awesome tutorials. Some of the code in this project originated from his site, and was used to help jump right into using the python-sc2 module and seeing how it works.

Bots use either pysc2 (https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) for reinforcement learning, or python-sc2 (https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) for traditional bot AI.
