This is just a project to play around with a combination of traditional AI and reinforcement learning in Starcraft 2.

I would like to credit Harrison at https://pythonprogramming.net/ for his awesome tutorials. Some of the code in this project originated from following his tutorials, and was used to help jump right into using the python-sc2 module and seeing how it works.
